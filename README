Work Flow(this directory is processing run11 AuAu200GeV embedding data):

0. change the "108" in the submit.sh

1. just run "./submit.sh"

2. in the reconstruct_mcv0.C, Block is the file number per loop processes. Nfiles is the total loops. 

======================If you want to run different distribution and different particles===========
1. change the reconstruct_mcv0.C the output directory

2. change the run.csh the filelist

3. submit the qsub_script.sh

* we have to commment out the setenv STAR_LEVEL SL11d in run.csh
